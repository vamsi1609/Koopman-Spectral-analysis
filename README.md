# Koopman Spectral analysis
Koopman Spectral analysis is an emerging non linear data analysis method which is used for Sequence modeling. One of the powerful practical use of Koopman operator is Dynamic Mode Decomposition(DMD)[1]. After thoroughy going through several research work, there has been an attempt to give an idea about the Koopman analysis in a simple way.

Koopman operator idea is very much similar to the Kernel methods. For any non linear dynamics in a particular space, there exists some linear space where the dynamics behave linearly. One small example is given in the above figure.
